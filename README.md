Architecture: 

Algoridge is an oracle based bridge between algorand and avalanche. 

Three main architectures are:

Algoridge-Avax: It contains bridge and liquidity contracts in solidity as well as the oracle interactions.

Algoridge-Algorand: It contains PyTeal liquidity and bridge contracts for oracle interactions.

Oracle solution: This script keeps in sync between the two chains to release the corresponding tokens.
